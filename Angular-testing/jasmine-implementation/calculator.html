<!-- 
    Spec file/Unit test file Naming conventions
    ---------------------------------------------

    Normally we will see different test file names in the different projects

    Common spec file/unit test file name extensions we come across will be like 

    *.spec.js  -- * is the file name and spec.js is file extension
    *.test.js

    Finally the unit testing file should be as 
    (target file name).spec.js

    Target file name is nothing but the source file for which we are writing the unit tests.
    In our case it is calculator.js file so therefore the test file will be calculator.spec.js

    A suits is simply a group of specs also we can say it as group of tests.
    If you have lots of tests you will group them and that group is called as Suite


    describe() is a method which is used to create a test suite and it is present globally once you added jasmine to your project so there is no need to import and all
    
    **Remember that: Spec and test are one and the same pretty much. But in jasmine we refer to test as spec
                     A spec is short from of specification
                     A spec is a set(group) of expectations that test the state of the code

      //spec can be define use it() method . it contains two parameter firts title and second anaonymus function where you will write your expectation

    Expectation you can think of it as assertion . Assertion is just a statement and the result of the statement either true or false(boolean)

    Lets see with an example. We know that 5+5 =10 --) statement

    For the above statement we write expectation as 
    Expect 5+5 to be 10. And the result of this statement is true
    Expect 5+4 to be 10 //That is actually false 

    So to write such expectation in jasmine , jasmine provide one method that is called expect()

    **What is passing spec and what is failing spec
    ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Spec with all true expectations is a passing spec. No matter we have 100 expectations, all expectations should be true
    If we have a spec with one or more false expectations then it is a failing spec

    **How to disable the test or test suits- Not by removing or commenting particular spec
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    DISABLED spec is a spec that will report as pending and will not be executed.
    
    When we need to write the disabled spec: Mostly  :

    1.When you have changes in the code and you want to disable the spec from failing until your changes are completed

   ** To disable one particular spec just put x before the it() method . Now your this test would be visible with msg that this spec/test is pending
   
    xit('should add number to the total',function()
    {
      const calculator = new Calculator()
      calculator.add(5)

      expect(calculator.total).toBe(5)
    })


    **To disable a entire test suite just put x before the describe() method .


    **What is matcher in jasmine 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    A matcher is just a function and this function implements a boolean comparison between the actual value and expected value.

    A matcher is also has the responsibile to report to the jasmine if the expectation is true or false.
    Ultimately matcher decides whether the spec should be a passing spec or failing spec

    **NEGATING A MATCHER
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You can put not before any matcher to negate it or your matcher will behave in opposite manner

    ex.  it('should have unique calculator object')
    {
         const calculator1 = new Calculator() 
         const calculator2 = new Calculator() 
         expect(calculator1).not.toBe(calculator2) // now this matcher will behave opposite way


    }

   ** Jasmine's built-in matchers are very useful and work well in most scenarios. However sometimes we need to develp custom matchers to implement specific scenarios

   A custom matcher at its root is a comparison function that takes an actual value and expected value.

   To use a custom matcher you have to Register the custom matchers with Jasmine.addMatchers

   Once a custom matcher is registered with Jamine , it is avaliable on any expectation.

   const customMatcher = 
   {
       return {
           Compare : function(actual,expected)
           {
               return 
               {
                   Pass:true,
                   Message:''
               }
           }
       }
   }



   **SETUP and TEARDOWN in Jasmine
   ---------------------------------------------
   To orgnize our specs more we need to know about the Setup and Teardown
   Setup and TearDown is a part of the life cycle for our suits.

   Setup is where you place prerequisites for your specs
   it executes before specs are run. Jasmine offer two methods for this

   beforeEach and beforeAll : these are two setup methods

   **beforeEach: is executed before each spec it the suite in which it is called.

   For example if you have 10 specs in the suite and you have a beforeEach method. That beforeEach method will be executed 10 times. That means One time before each spec execution

   **beforeAll is very similar to beforeEach but it is executed only once before all the specs in the suite in which it is called


   **Teardown in the life cycle of our suite is used to clean up the steps for your specs.
     Teardown methods are executed after all specs are run

     Jasmine offer two methods that are part of the teardown cycle
     **afterEach
     **afterAll


     **Jasmine Spies

     Jasmine is made for unit testing. Unit tests are supposed to tets only one component of your application.A component can be a function , an object, a module, basically everything self-contained that acts like a black box to the outside world.

     You usually want to avoid that your unit tests fail because another component failed. Thats why you want to test your components in isolation as much as possible.

     Spies create test doubles and help us to isolate dependencies for true unit testing

     A test double is an object that can stand in for a real object in a test.
